## 🔥 The Juicy Details

<!--
Explain what changed, why it changed, and how it works.
Be specific about:
- Which files/classes/methods were modified
- The business need or technical reason for the change
- Architecture patterns or ARCHITECTURE.md references followed
- Any interesting implementation details

Break down by project/scope if this spans multiple components:
### Changes in `aspire1.ApiService` (api)
- Added CachedWeatherService implementing IDistributedCache
- Updated DI registration in Program.cs

### Changes in `aspire1.Web` (web)
- Switched to cached weather endpoints
- Added cache TTL configuration
-->

## ✅ Testing Sorcery

<!--
What testing did you perform?
- Unit test results (count, coverage %)
- Integration test scenarios
- Manual testing steps
- Any edge cases covered

Example:
- ✅ All 47 unit tests passed
- ✅ Integration tests verify Redis cache hit/miss behavior
- ✅ Manually tested weather forecast caching in local Aspire dashboard
- ✅ Added 12 new test cases covering cache expiration scenarios

## 🎭 Breaking Changes?

<!--
Does this PR break existing functionality, APIs, or deployment configurations?

If YES:
⚠️ **YES** - This will break existing [thing]:
- Specific breaking change description
- **Migration:** Step-by-step instructions to migrate existing code/config
- Impact: Who/what is affected

If NO:
✅ **NOPE** - Backward compatible. Deploy with reckless abandon.

## 🍿 Reviewer Notes (aka please don't hate me)

<!--
Important context for reviewers:
- Deployment considerations (environment variables, Key Vault secrets, infra changes)
- Configuration changes required (appsettings, azd environment)
- Rollback strategy if things go sideways
- What to watch in production after deployment
- Any technical debt or follow-up work needed
- Links to relevant ARCHITECTURE.md sections

Example:
⚠️ Requires Redis configured in Azure Container Apps environment
📚 Follows caching patterns from aspire1.ServiceDefaults/ARCHITECTURE.md
🔄 Rollback: Remove REDIS_CONNECTION env var and redeploy previous version
👀 Monitor: Redis connection metrics in Application Insights after deployment

No databases were harmed in the making of this PR. 🎉
