## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Workflows

| Workflow | File | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Multistage Deploy** | `multistage-deploy.yml` | Production pipeline with 3 environments |
| **Simple Deploy** | `deploy.yml` | Quick single-environment deployment |

### Environments

| Environment | Purpose | Approval | Deployment |
|-------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **Dev** | Development/testing | None | Automatic on push to main |
| **Stage** | Pre-production | 1-2 reviewers | Manual approval after dev |
| **Prod** | Production | 2+ reviewers + 5min wait | Manual approval after stage |

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build & Version** - Compile code, extract version with MinVer
2. **Test (Parallel)** - Run Web.Tests and WeatherService.Tests simultaneously
3. **Deploy Dev** - Deploy to development environment
4. **Deploy Stage** - Deploy to staging (requires approval)
5. **Deploy Prod** - Deploy to production (requires approval + wait)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **GitHub Actions** - CI/CD automation platform
- **Azure Developer CLI (azd)** - Infrastructure provisioning and deployment
- **Azure Container Apps** - Hosting platform
- **OIDC** - Secure authentication without secrets
- **MinVer** - Automatic semantic versioning
- **.NET 9** - Application framework

## 📊 Pipeline Metrics

Track these metrics for pipeline health:

| Metric | Target | Where to Check |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Build Success Rate** | >95% | GitHub Actions insights |
| **Test Success Rate** | >98% | GitHub Actions insights |
| **Deployment Time (Dev)** | <10 min | Workflow run summary |
| **Deployment Time (Full)** | <20 min | Workflow run summary |
| **Pipeline Failure Rate** | <5% | GitHub Actions insights |

## 🔐 Security

The pipeline uses **OIDC authentication** for security:

- ✅ No secrets stored in GitHub (only client IDs)
- ✅ Time-limited tokens
- ✅ Environment-specific service principals
- ✅ Least-privilege access (Contributor role per subscription)
- ✅ Audit trail in Azure AD

## 📈 Pipeline Evolution

The pipeline has been designed for evolution:

**Current State:**
- 3 environments (dev, stage, prod)
- Parallel testing
- Manual approvals for stage/prod
- OIDC authentication

**Future Enhancements (Ideas):**
- Integration tests in pipeline
- Performance testing stage
- Blue/green deployments
- Canary releases
- Automated rollback
- Deployment notifications (Slack, Teams)

## 🤝 Contributing

When modifying the pipeline:

1. Test changes in a feature branch
2. Validate workflow syntax with yamllint
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Run through [PIPELINE_TESTING.md](PIPELINE_TESTING.md) checklist
5. Document breaking changes clearly
