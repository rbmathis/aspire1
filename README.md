# 🚀 aspire1 - Your Cloud-Native Playground

> **Because deploying to Azure should be this easy.** ✨

Welcome to **aspire1**, a production-ready .NET Aspire application that's basically showing off. It's got everything: Blazor Server, Minimal APIs, Redis caching, Azure App Configuration, Feature Flags, and—oh yeah—**Application Insights with custom metrics that'll make your dashboards jealous**.

Think of it as the Swiss Army knife of modern .NET applications, except it actually deploys to Azure Container Apps without making you cry. 🎉

---

## 🎯 What's This Thing Do?

**Short answer:** Weather forecasts. Revolutionary, right?

**Real answer:** This is a **reference architecture** that demonstrates how to build cloud-native applications with .NET Aspire. It's got all the bells and whistles you'd want in a production app:

- 🌐 **Blazor Server** frontend (because SignalR is cool)
- 🔌 **REST API** backend (Minimal APIs style, naturally)
- 📊 **Custom telemetry** (tracks sunny days and counter clicks—priorities!)
- 💾 **Redis caching** (with graceful offline fallback)
- 🎚️ **Feature flags** (toggle features without redeploying like a boss)
- 🔐 **Key Vault secrets** (because committing passwords is _so_ 2015)
- 📈 **Application Insights** (with pre-built dashboards that actually make sense)
- 🚨 **Automated alerts** (emails you when things get spicy)

---

## 🎬 Quick Start (The "Just Let Me Run It" Version)

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 10.0 SDK** ([download here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- **Docker Desktop** (optional for local dev, but Redis appreciates it)
- **Azure CLI** ([install here](https://aka.ms/azure-cli))
- **azd** ([Azure Developer CLI](https://aka.ms/azd-install))
- A sense of adventure 🧭

### Run Locally (Offline-First FTW)

```bash
# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/rbmathis/aspire1.git
cd aspire1

# Restore packages (grab a coffee ☕)
dotnet restore

# Fire up the engines
dotnet run --project aspire1.AppHost/aspire1.AppHost.csproj
```

**Boom!** 💥 Your app is now running at:

- 🎛️ **Aspire Dashboard**: https://localhost:15888 (where the magic happens)
- 🌐 **Web Frontend**: https://localhost:7296 (click things, break things)
- 🔌 **API**: https://localhost:7002 (JSON for days)

**Pro tip:** No Azure? No problem! The app runs perfectly offline with in-memory fallbacks. Click the counter, check the weather, watch the metrics fly. 📊

---

## ☁️ Deploy to Azure (The "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button)

```bash
# Login to Azure (just once)
azd auth login

# Deploy EVERYTHING with one command
azd up
```

That's it. Seriously. `azd` will:

- ✅ Provision Azure resources (Container Apps, App Insights, Key Vault, Redis, App Config)
- ✅ Build Docker images
- ✅ Push to Azure Container Registry
- ✅ Deploy to Azure Container Apps
- ✅ Set up custom dashboards and alerts
- ✅ Pour you a virtual champagne 🍾

**Time:** ~3-5 minutes (depending on how fast Azure feels today)

**Translation:** Browser talks to Blazor, Blazor talks to API, everything snitches to Application Insights. 🕵️

## 📊 Custom Metrics (Because Default Telemetry is Boring)

This app tracks **6 custom metrics** that actually matter:

| Metric                               | What It Does                   | Why You Care                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🖱️ **counter.clicks**                | Counts button clicks by range  | See how bored your users are             |
| 🌤️ **weather.sunny.count**           | Tracks sunny forecasts by temp | Plan your beach day (or server capacity) |
| 📞 **weather.api.calls**             | Total API call volume          | Detect traffic spikes before they bite   |
| 💾 **cache.hits** / **cache.misses** | Cache performance              | Optimize that Redis bill                 |
| ⏱️ **api.call.duration**             | API latency distribution       | Keep users from rage-quitting            |

**View them:**

- **Locally:** Aspire Dashboard → Metrics → `aspire1.metrics`
- **Azure:** Application Insights → Custom Metrics

**Query them:**

```kusto
// Find your cache hit rate (higher = 💰 saved)
customMetrics
| where name == "cache.hits" or name == "cache.misses"
| summarize Hits = sumif(value, name == "cache.hits"),
            Misses = sumif(value, name == "cache.misses")
| extend HitRate = round(Hits * 100.0 / (Hits + Misses), 2)
```

---

## 🚨 Automated Alerts (The "Wake Up at 3 AM" Feature)

Three alerts are configured out-of-the-box:

1. **Cache Miss Rate >50%**

   - _Translation:_ "Your cache is basically decorative at this point"
   - **Severity:** ⚠️ Warning

2. **API Errors >5/min**

   - _Translation:_ "Houston, we have a problem"
   - **Severity:** 🚨 Error

3. **API Latency P95 >1000ms**
   - _Translation:_ "Users are watching their life flash before their eyes"
   - **Severity:** ⚠️ Warning

**Configure alert email:**

```bash
azd env set ALERT_EMAIL "your-email@example.com"
azd up
```

## 🎮 Cool Features to Try

### 1. **The Counter That Tells on You**

Navigate to `/counter` and start clicking. Watch the metrics dashboard light up like a Christmas tree. Each click is tracked with range categorization (0-10, 11-50, 51-100, 100+).

**Why ranges?** Turns out tracking individual numbers 1-10000 gets expensive. Grouping = smarter metrics = lower Azure bill. 💰

### 2. **Weather Forecasts with Personality**

Hit `/weather` and refresh a few times. The API tracks:

- How many times you called it (mild stalking)
- How many "Sunny" days appear (optimism metrics)
- Temperature ranges (for the data nerds)

### 3. **Feature Flags Magic**

Toggle the weather feature on/off in Azure App Configuration **without redeploying**:

```bash
# Disable weather feature (chaos mode)
az appconfig kv set --name <your-appconfig> \
  --key ".appconfig.featureflag/WeatherForecast" \
  --value '{"enabled":false}'

# Watch the API return 503 🔥
```

### 4. **Cache Performance Theater**

The weather API uses Redis caching with a 5-minute TTL. Watch the cache metrics:

- First call: Cache MISS (generates data)
- Next ~10 calls: Cache HIT (blazing fast 🏎️)
- After 5 minutes: Cache MISS again (the circle of life)

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Local Development (The Happy Path)

```bash
# Start everything
dotnet run --project aspire1.AppHost

# Make changes to code
# Press Ctrl+R to reload (hot reload FTW)

# Check metrics at https://localhost:15888
# Watch logs in real-time
# Feel like a 10x developer 😎
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific project tests
dotnet test aspire1.WeatherService.Tests
dotnet test aspire1.Web.Tests
```

### Versioning (Automatic SemVer)

This project uses **MinVer** for automatic semantic versioning based on git tags:

```bash
# Check current version
minver

# Tag a new release
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Added sunny forecast tracking"
git push --tags

# Next build will be v1.2.0
```

---

## 🔐 Secrets Management (The Paranoid Edition)

### Local Development: User Secrets

```bash
# Set secrets for local dev (never commits to git)
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:MyDb" "..." --project aspire1.WeatherService
```

### Azure: Key Vault References

```bash
# In Azure, connection strings are injected via Key Vault
# Format: @Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://...)
# Managed Identity handles auth (zero passwords in code)
```

**Golden Rule:** If it's a password, API key, or connection string, it goes in Key Vault. No exceptions. 🔒

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting (When Things Get Weird)

### "My metrics aren't showing up!"

```bash
# Check Aspire Dashboard
# Navigate to https://localhost:15888 → Metrics
# Search for "aspire1.metrics"

# If empty, generate data:
# - Click counter button 50 times
# - Visit /weather page
# - Check metrics again
```

### "Application Insights isn't receiving data"

```bash
# Verify connection string
azd env get-values | grep APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING

# Check console logs for:
# ✅ Application Insights telemetry enabled
# (If you see ⚠️ offline mode, connection string is missing)
```

### "Build failed with restore errors"

```bash
# Nuclear option (fixes 99% of weird build issues)
dotnet clean
rm -rf **/bin **/obj
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### "I deployed but nothing works"

```bash
# Check deployment logs
azd deploy --debug

# View container logs
az containerapp logs show --name aspire1-web --resource-group <rg-name> --follow

# Common issues:
# - Missing environment variables
# - Key Vault permissions not set
# - App Configuration not configured
```
